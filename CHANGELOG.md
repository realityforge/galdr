* Use the `org.realityforge.proton:proton` project for processor utility methods.
* Include the location of the problem when generating warnings for unnecessary public or protected access on members.
* Decouple the `processor` artifact from the `com.google.auto:auto-common` dependency and thus the `com.google.guava:guava` dependency. This significantly reduces the build time for the processor and the size of the processor artifact.
